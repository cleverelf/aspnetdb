#summary How to build and install this application
#labels Build,Setup

= Minimum System Requirements =
  # MS.NET 2.0
  # Visual Studio Express (Web developer)
  # SQL Server 2005 (This is the one I've tested this app with but others should work too)

= Build Setup =

  # If not already existing then setup the ASP.NET Membership DB on an SQL Server instance. It can be easily done via Aspnet_regsql.exe (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229862(VS.80).aspx)
  # Checkout the code from trunk here
  # Edit the connection string in Web.config such that it points to the above Membership DB on your SQL Server
  # For this application to work you need to setup at least one user with "admin" role in the target membership DB. This can be done either via:
    # Visual Studio through Project->ASP.NET Configuration menu
    # Directly adding entries into DB via SQL
  # Build the application in Visual Studio
  # Launch and logon using the above "admin" user. You should be able to see the application, user and role management options.
